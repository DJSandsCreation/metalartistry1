a small project here like a presentation Web site, not really like a mainstream Web site but something that maybe you would do at some kind of conference/event as a presentation and PowerPoint doesnt quite cut it, something custom, its very simplified but I will add graphics to it later, as I go .. I'll be using a bunch of stuff that I've learned through the animations etc, like variables, a little bit of a key frame animation transition stuff. I plan to have more versions as I add more as I like to see where it started,
