/*1. starting on the CSS

so first thing, want to  set some variables so set the root scope, just want to have colors for each page, also the animation speed, cuz in the beginning when landing page loads, having the heading come in from top, paragraph come coming from side andwant to state speed to be inside of a variable, say dash dash page dash 1 dash color and I'm going to set this to steel blue, gonna use color names and copy this as we have 4 pages, add different colors,add a variable animate dash speed so can easily change the speed of  animation, gonna set to one second for now, so those are our variables. */

/* 2. body styles
for the body font family arial then line height usually about 1.4, color white by default and then zero out the margin & padding, 
  body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.4;
  color: #fff;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
so don't want scroll bars to show, big part of the project NO SCROLL BARS, so overflow set that hidden, 
      overflow: hidden;

/* Page Colors */

/* 3. as  we set text to white , sort out the colors now, going to tack on to the I.D., all sections have a class of page, there will be elemets they will share but my pln is for them to be unique, so do I.D, page 1 and do background set to var dash dash, page number dash color
  #page-1 { background: var(--page-1-color) }
copy and change page numbers and inside the var page numbers too  to coincide with root variable settings

/* 4. The Pages
every page gonna want to take up the whole viewport, add page class, display as flex, as soon asdo that everything's goes into a row
     .page {
     display: flex;
horizontal which I don't want, so say flex dash direction, want a column and now goes back to  vertical, now set the height for 100 viewport heights, save but only showing the first page
      flex-direction: column;
      height: 100vh;
want to align, say a line dash items, center, that's gonna align  horizontal into center, then do justify dash content to the center and save, now it's a line both horizontal and vertical.
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
also adding text align center so text itself centered, add a little padding on the left and right - zero top and bottom & 4REM left and right just so not right up against the edge
        text-align: center;
        padding: 0 4rem;

do the button, has a class of BTN, want to display as inline block as for as padding - gonna be a pretty big button so do 1REM top/bottom 2REM left/right, make the background light by default #f4f4f4, text color 333 and iflink take away the text decoration= none, also add board=none, do margin dash top 1REM just to push, font size a little bigger so 1.1REM by default, Now when hover over wanted it to change to a dark color but also want to transition, so add a transition to all and gonna be really quick say 0.3s and say ease in, but doesn't do anything cuz don't have hover yet*/

add BTN colon hover, want the background to be dark and the color to be light, save that, now when hover over see it transitions to dark rather than just clicking or it switching to a dark color.
we also want to have a dark version of the button, to be this exact styling, so adding a comma here and  say BTN dash dark

  .btn-dark

to have same styling but the opposite, so copy

if I click, see goes to the next page, can navigate up and down the pages, so optional to add the Jquery aas it works really well at this point. . .

only animating page one cuz only using HTML & CSS right now, .. could use JavaScript or Jquery to make it so when it hits a certain point it could animate the next one and the next one, etc

But thats what I might try later. . . 
so for now I am just making landing page to animate so */
/* Page Animation 2
so taking page ID and targetting h1, add a transform then translate, set this to be off the page so going to do negative and do twelve hundred and save
  transform: translateY(-1200px);
so moved it on the y axis,moved it up since its a negative value it's just up off the page, make sure you go up high enough, if you don't go up high enough and someone with very large screen then there's still going to be able to see it, taking that into account, now to animate - say animation - call the animation headings since that's what targetting, want the speed which already put in the ROOT so, speed animated speed and want forwards cuz want it to stay there or it'll come down and disappear, do an ease in now to set the key frame

so copied  #page-1 h1 { transform: translateY(-1200px); animation: heading var(--animate-speed) forwards ease-in;}
change to paragraph, do translate X and just in case a really wide screen set to negative 1800px then animation want to change this to call this text, could have different speeds for each one, keeping them same for now,need to add a delaycuz want the heading to come down and then the the paragraph after so add a delay of two seconds 
now to set next keyframe

say at key frames, called it heading , copy original space, grab

set the translate Y to zero which is its original spot

now to do the same thing for the paragraph
