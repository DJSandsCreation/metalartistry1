<!-- 1.(HTML) a small project here like a presentation Web site, not really like a mainstream Web site but something that maybe you would do at some kind of conference/event as a presentation and PowerPoint doesnt quite cut it, something custom, its very simplified but I will add graphics to it later, as I go .. I'll be using a bunch of stuff that I've learned through the animations etc, like variables, a little bit of a key frame animation transition stuff -->

<!-- Page 1 (Intro) -->

    // Smooth Scrolling snippet

    //So now when I click the next page it scrolls down all right cuz we told it for anything with class button on click gonna run function and basically gonna check the hash which is the ID has page 3 and gonna scroll to that area using the animate, can chage the speed 400 goes faster, 1400 goes much faster, think 800 is pretty good

    $('.btn').on('click', function(event) {
        if (this.hash !== '') {
          event.preventDefault();
          const hash = this.hash;
